                <h3>Welcome Coco</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                I’m so excited to introduce our new family member Coco!! She is a year old Terrier Yorkshire Mix puppy. She is so sweet, 
                she just melts my heart and I can’t help but to fall in love with her every minute. So, these past 4 days I have been in a mom’s puppy mode. In the 
                spirit of having a new puppy I wanted to post 6 things to expect from a new dog or puppy!

                </h2>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>
                One may ask; how many times should I walk my puppy? Well that depends on the breed and how much energy  your fur-baby has. 
                For a puppy I would say 15-20 minutes twice a day and once they are fully grown you may increase it based on your dogs breed and energy. 
                Some dogs are just fine being couch potatoes and some need to be outdoors moving. So once you understand your dog’s personality you will likely know what s/he can take.

                </h2>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>
                I have never been much of an early riser but I find myself waking up early in the morning without any hesitation. I go outside with no makeup, wearing my PJs
                and take her outside to use the bathroom. Normally I would be hesitant to be up this early. I really think we are lucky because she is already potty 
                 trained but she still has accidents with her pee pads which makes sense given her spay status.

                <p>
                Set up dog play dates and dog park time. At the beginning it an overwhelming experience, mostly in a good way. Your dog will change your daily schedule. 
                You will have to keep your dog entertained, emotional and physically fit. The saying that goes; a dog is a man’s best friend, is not a coincidence. 
                Dogs are social creatures, they love their humans and they are truly happy to have you spending time with them. They enjoy being patted and praised 
                because their goal is to win your affection.

                <p>
                Dogs are smarter than what we give them credit for, with that being said your dog/puppy will do exactly what you teach them to do. 
                If you don’t train your puppy they will behave however they want.

                </h2>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>Be consistence with your dog training, dogs are like babies, so you have to be patient with when training them.  
                    When training a dog start out with verbs and remember our language is new to them. Motion to them and use a commanding 
                    tone making sure they have your attention. Dogs, especially puppies they have so much energy and short attention span therefore, 
                    during training you have to keep them engaged and motivated, by rewarding every step with treats and praise.</p>

                </h2>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>Unless you are planning to breed your dog, it is important to spay your dog to avoid your dog peeing all over the place, endlessly. 
                    It is important to Spay/Neuter your puppy as soon as they are passed eight weeks old. Spaying/Neutering them also helps them not 
                    to bleed during heat. See, when we got Coco she was not 
                    spayed but to us that wasn’t a deal breaker because I thought it would be an easy fix. I assured husband who was 
                    reluctant to get her without being spayed. To my surprise, two days later we were calling 
                    different veterinarians and pet clinics for an immediate spay surgery. </p>
