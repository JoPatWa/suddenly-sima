                    Sometimes you just don’t want to deal with getting on a plane or driving to the coast. Sometimes you just want to start the

                    fun immediately without the figuring out how to get there. Life is an adventure so don’t cheat yourself

                    when it comes to happiness. I’m telling you, you can’t go wrong with the state fair. If you want to turn

                    your fun mode on without breaking the bank, then don’t think twice about going to your nearby county

                    or state fair. I’m a sucker for a thrill and adventure so when I heard the annual NC State fair was coming,

                    I thought that I definitely needed to check it out. Plus the state fairgrounds are right next door to

                    my apartment! So for the first time I decided to go to the state fair, however I must admit that I got

                    a little skeptical after every search engine result I hit came with the stats of “fair rides accidents”

                    but statically the odds against vs. the odds in favor of anyone breaking their neck on the fair rides

                    is as low as .00007% out of 1.2 million. You have greater chances of being bitten by a venomous snake

                    than actually falling out of the swing of a fair ride and die. However, it’s up to you to do a research

                    and rationalize your decision.

                </p>

                <p>

                    That is enough about tragic incidents that may or may not happen so let’s jump on this fair fun wheel! As I was saying, I

                    went to the state fair for the very first time in my life and the fair was filled with awe. It was one

                    of the best affordable adventures I’ve experienced. Keep in mind, this event only happens once a year

                    and it marks the end of summer. I was all “gummy” in and out of the fair gates because I was so happy

                    and I was experiencing the positive energy from the crowd. Hearing the screams fading in and out as the

                    riders sling shot up in the air by wobbly fair rides was enough to make my heart jump out. It was so

                    crowded that you could barely move. I could feel myself shuffling my weight deep into the crowd to make

                    my way to my desired direction. As I shove my way deep into the crowd I was greeted by the smell of greasy

                    sweet treats that filled the whole place and it sure was calling up for my taste buds to give it a try.

                </p>

                <p>

                    This whole thing was beyond what I imagined. One of the most impressive things I noticed was that in the midst of all the

                    rush and thousands of old and young being crammed in one space, people there were still courteous, patient

                    and kind to one another. They didn’t mind making a conversation with a stranger or offering to take a

                    picture. The fair employees were considerate and patient to answer anyone’s questions without any hesitation

                    and even went beyond that. Among other things I did was take a stroll in the agricultural barn and I

                    came across a lady by the name of Cindy who showed me the biggest sweet potato in North Carolina. That

                    sweet potato weighs 10.11lb’s! Also there was a giant pumpkin that was also grown in North Carolina.

                    An inspiring fact was that for every ticket sold the state fair pledged to donate $2 to Wake public schools.

                    Did you know that the NC state fair is one of the biggest fair due to agricultural per capita? There

                    are so many reasons to go to the fair, either for fun rides, greasy and interesting treats, checking

                    out live stocks, cute little chicks or simply getting fresh fruits and vegetables. What is there not

                    to love!?
