                <p>

                    Fall is in full swing, so this means our blouse and sweaters are getting bigger and sleeves are getting longer too. Fall

                    is one of my favorites because I get a chance to be creative with my outfits, mixing both bright and

                    dark colors. These past years since I’ve been in the US, I have been wearing skinny pants and jeggings

                    due to the fact that I have long legs, jeans and formal pants of my size are just not long enough. Before

                    traveling here. I lived in countries like South Africa and India that offered handful of couturiers therefore

                    that gave me many bottom outfit options. Once I lived here I realized that having someone to tailor your

                    outfit is a luxury that comes with a hefty price so that is the reason behind my limited bottom options.

                <h2 class="text-center text-lg text-uppercase my-0">Simple Cues

                </h2>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>

                    There are two key elements that are vital when looking into your closet or when going through a shopping rack at the store

                    this fall. One is the right size; something that fit well and secondly is warmth, keep our body warm.

                    While I went shopping last week I notice that long cardigans and chunky boots are popping up on almost

                    every store window display. As temperatures drops, boots and leg warmers will be on everyone’s shopping

                    list and I’m the first to confess to that covering up your legs is not only chic, but it keeps your body

                    well protected from harsh weather. This is the best time to wear tight pants, accompanied by a blouse

                    and top it up with a long cardigan that I can take it off once I settle into a warm space.

                </p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <h2 class="text-center text-lg text-uppercase my-0">Dressing To Your Body Type

                </h2>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>The key factor in looking elegant while keeping warm is knowing how to dress your body, not going by the

                    fads or what is trending. Dressing chic involves understanding your body shape and what looks good on

                    you. Trends come and go but your body shape and proportions are generally going to stay the same (unless

                    you go through a body transformation process) so covering it up with pieces that compliments it shape

                    is vital in avoiding humiliating “wardrobe malfunction”. Layering is an art itself, so learn how to properly

                    layer your outfit which will give you a proper appearance while keeping warm during cold seasons.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center text-lg text-uppercase my-0">Simplify your closet and save Moola

                </h2>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>Have you found yourself under stress when it comes to deciding what to wear? Browsing nonstop with no happy

                    results? Maybe it is that time to simplify your closet. Did you know that H&M will accept your old clothes

                    that you no longer need from any brands in any condition? Yes it’s true! H&M isn’t trying to hide this

                    but still seems to be one of the best-kept savings secretes. The donation bins are simply located near

                    the cash register. Simply locate an employee and let them know you have some clothes to donate. They

                    will assist and in return they will provide you with a 15% discount off on your next in -store purchase.

                    You can donate up to two bags a day and the coupons are good for several months. Each bag should include

                    at least three to five items of clothing. This is something to consider doing this fall without breaking

                    a bank to get some of that dazzling essence of the season. There are plenty other places that runs the

                    same programs including thrift stores, Levis, Goodwill and etc. </p>



                <p>What is your best fall apparel you are looking forward to rock this fall and have you consider making donations

                    to H&M or other donation programs in your area? </p>
